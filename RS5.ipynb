       " 'About': {0: 'The boy\\'s name was \"Santiago\". It was dusk when he arrived at an abandoned church with his sheep. The roof of the church collapsed a long time ago and a large plantain tree had grown in the place that was previously used for sacred vessels.\\nHe decided to spend the night there. He brought all the sheep into the sack through the broken door and blocked the door with some poles and boards so that no sheep could leave during the night. There was no trace of a wolf in that area, but one night when one of his sheep was separated from the flock, he had to spend the whole next day looking for that animal. He swept the floor with his coat and lay down, placing the book he had finished a while ago on his pillow. \"I must start reading thicker books,\" she said to herself, \"because they will both take longer to read and be more comfortable pillows.\"',\n",
       "  1: 'The world is a well of distress in the absence of sun. After his departure, my soul is dry, my day is sunless. I can\\'t sleep at night, I\\'m restless at home during the day. Not here, not anywhere else. I am like a ghost in the crowd. I am upset because of everyone, I am disobedient because of everyone, it is not my fault. How can they continue to live as if nothing happened? Is it possible to live without Tabriz? Every night, from dawn to dusk, I sit alone in the library and say nothing. I only think of Shams. But because Shams is the sum of everything and everyone in my opinion, I think of the whole universe. His words never leave my mind: one day you will be called the poet of the most beautiful love poems. You will become famous all over the world.\\n\\nIf you lose someone you love, a part of you will be lost along with them. Like an abandoned house, he becomes a prisoner of bitter loneliness; You remain incomplete. You keep the lost loved one like a secret inside you. It is so wounded that with the passage of time, no matter how long, it will not be relieved. It is so wounded that even when it heals, it still bleeds. You think you will never laugh again, you will never be light. Your life becomes like walking in the dark; Without seeing what\\'s in front of you, without knowing the direction, you only save the present... The candle in your heart is extinguished, you are left in the night of darkness.\\n\\nShams continued with the same calm and dignified tone: \"Shager Mogarmez, you say you want to step into the sea of \\u200b\\u200bSufism, but you are not willing to pay the price. It can\\'t be like that! For one, money and wealth are the main trap, for another, fame and status, for another, body and lust! First of all, a person should get rid of the thing that is most important to him in this world. This is the first condition to step on this path.\\n\\nEvery human remains like a book in his essence; Waiting to be read. Each of us is basically a walking and breathing book. It is enough to know our essence. Are you a prostitute or a virgin? It doesn\\'t matter if you fall or rebel; The desire to find God is hidden in the hearts of all of us, deep within us. From the moment we are born, we carry the gem of love inside us.\\n\\nA life without love is wasted. Do not ask whether I should be in divine love or figurative love, earthly love or heavenly love, or carnal love? Differences make differences. However, love does not need any complement or adjective. Love is a world by itself. Either you are right in the middle of it, in its fire, or you are outside it, in its longing.',\n",
       "  2: '- Every human being is the owner of his own death and can act in any way he wants. Maybe... and only maybe... the right to live can be taken from every human being, but the right to die cannot be denied under any circumstances.\\n- Although we cannot escape from fate. But we have to deal with it. We must decide our destiny. We must love our destiny.\\n- The peak means the high point in the ascent of life.

The roof of the church collapsed a long time ago and a large plantain tree had grown in the place that was previously used for sacred vessels.\\nHe decided to spend the night there. He brought all the sheep into the sack through the broken door and blocked the door with some poles and boards so that no sheep could leave during the night. There was no trace of a wolf in that area, but one night when one of his sheep was separated from the flock, he had to spend the whole next day looking for that animal. He swept the floor with his coat and lay down, placing the book he had finished a while ago on his pillow. \"I must start reading thicker books,\" she said to herself, \"because they will both take longer to read and be more comfortable pillows.\" پائولو کوئیلو Classical literature Classical literature',\n",
       "  1: 'Romantic The world is a well of distress in the absence of sun. After his departure, my soul is dry, my day is sunless. I can\\'t sleep at night, I\\'m restless at home during the day. Not here, not anywhere else. I am like a ghost in the crowd. I am upset because of everyone, I am disobedient because of everyone, it is not my fault. How can they continue to live as if nothing happened? Is it possible to live without Tabriz? Every night, from dawn to dusk, I sit alone in the library and say nothing. I only think of Shams. But because Shams is the sum of everything and everyone in my opinion, I think of the whole universe. His words never leave my mind: one day you will be called the poet of the most beautiful love poems. You will become famous all over the world.\\n\\nIf you lose someone you love, a part of you will be lost along with them. Like an abandoned house, he becomes a prisoner of bitter loneliness; You remain incomplete. You keep the lost loved one like a secret inside you. It is so wounded that with the passage of time, no matter how long, it will not be relieved. It is so wounded that even when it heals, it still bleeds. You think you will never laugh again, you will never be light. Your life becomes like walking in the dark; Without seeing what\\'s in front of you, without knowing the direction, you only save the present... The candle in your heart is extinguished, you are left in the night of darkness.\\n\\nShams continued with the same calm and dignified tone: \"Shager Mogarmez, you say you want to step into the sea of \\u200b\\u200bSufism, but you are not willing to pay the price. It can\\'t be like that! For one, money and wealth are the main trap, for another, fame and status, for another, body and lust! First of all, a person should get rid of the thing that is most important to him in this world. This is the first condition to step on this path.\\n\\nEvery human remains like a book in his essence; Waiting to be read. Each of us is basically a walking and breathing book. It is enough to know our essence. Are you a prostitute or a virgin? It doesn\\'t matter if you fall or rebel; The desire to find God is hidden in the hearts of all of us, deep within us. From the moment we are born, we carry the gem of love inside us.\\n\\nA life without love is wasted. Do not ask whether I should be in divine love or figurative love, earthly love or heavenly love, or carnal love? Differences make differences. However, love does not need any complement or adjective. Love is a world by itself. Either you are right in the middle of it, in its fire, or you are outside it, in its longing. الیف شافاک Romantic Romantic',\n",

Maybe... and only maybe... the right to live can be taken from every human being, but the right to die cannot be denied under any circumstances.\\n- Although we cannot escape from fate. But we have to deal with it. We must decide our destiny. We must love our destiny.\\n- The peak means the high point in the ascent of life.

Because in this way, nature sees a person naked...\" However, such words should not be taken too seriously. Of course, gaining experience as a doctor can provide a good basis for creating fascinating narratives or producing great works of art, but the same can be true for more or less all other professions. It is basically the case that a person has a natural desire to distinguish himself; So it is not strange that the doctor-writers believe in the existence of a fundamental, special and unique connection between medicine and literature and talk about it with Suzugdaz.
